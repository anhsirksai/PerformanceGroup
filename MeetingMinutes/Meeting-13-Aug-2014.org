* Performance Goup Meeting Minutes. 2014-08-13 Wed

** Performance and Model checking.
+  Tools : Explore SPIN and NuSMV.
+  Conferences and papers to look out:
   - LICS
   - find out papers from ACM transactions in performance area.

** Broad picture to look at performance of a system.
+  System can be a 
   - BlackBox : we just depend on the input provided to the system and other external factors to improve the performance.
   - Whitebox : Modifying the actual system and do a performance study.

** Performance in various levels
| Applications |
| Compilers    |
| Network      |
| Hardware     |

** Areas identified to explore :
| performance of cloud and virtualization technologies.(ex: live migration)             |
| performance based on client side of web-applications(browser performance)             |
| Machine learning techniques and static analysis methods to build performance systems. |

** Performance from a ML perspective:
+  depending on the *Analytic study*/*Assumptions* we come up with a *function* with *co-efficients(that map to invariants of a system)*.
   Insert this function into the system and predict the performance.

** Study tasks Identified
[[Performance Evaluation Process Algebra][http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/pepa/]]
[[Process Algebras for Quantitative Analysis][http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/pepa/quantitativeanalysis.pdf]]

** Date of Next meeting   2014-08-27 Wed
+  Presenter: sai krishna on the paper *Process Algebras for Quantitative Analysis*
